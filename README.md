for PXT/microbit

how do i rotary encoder?

for using the ky040 rotary encoder PXT on the microbit


known issues:

 - ~~button is broken~~

 - ~~there are hardcoded event and device IDs - not sure if it's possible to work around this~~

 - both of the above are now fixed, it uses a single fiber to monitor the button though
